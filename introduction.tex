Category theory is a branch of mathematics developed in the 1940s
which has come to occupy a central position in computer science.
Broadly, it is a convenient and powerful conceptual framework or
language of structures and systems of structures
\parencites[vii]{maclane-1998}[1]{marquis-2013}[1154]{wolfram-2002}.

In computer science, category theory contributes to areas such as
automata theory, domain theory, functional programming, monads or
notions of computation, polymorphism, semantics, type theory, among
others
\parencites[23]{marquis-2013}{nlab-category-theory}[xi]{pierce-1991}[415]{poigne-1992}.

In computer science, category theory allows us to formulate
definitions and theories and to measure the elegance and coherence of
existing formulations, to carry out proofs, to discover and exploit
relations with other fields, to deal with abstraction and
representation independence, to formulate conjectures and research
directions, and to unify concepts \parencites[49--50]{goguen-1991}. In
addition, category theory is a foundational theory of functions which
provides a sound basis for functional programming
\parencite[414]{poigne-1992}.

``Category theory can be viewed as a formalization of operations on
abstract data types in computer languages''
\parencite[1154]{wolfram-2002}.






In functional programming,

``Most structures in mathematics are best understood from a category
theoretic viewpoint'' \parencite{nlab-category-theory}.

``Several concepts in Haskell are inspired or taken from category
theory. The most notable example being monads. When these concepts are
taken from category theory, however, very little of the theory around
them is brought along. This is why, despite claims to the contrary,
one can be a perfectly competent programmer without knowing anything
at all about category theory. But, if you are familiar with category
theory, you can turn around and apply it to Haskell''
\parencite[73]{elkins-2009}. ``The goal here is not to provide
intuition about monads, but instead to provide tools for analyzing and
building them and related structures. One could even say that the goal
is how you could arrive at these monads without intuition''
\parencite[73]{elkins-2009}.

Some functional programming languages (such as Haskell) have certain
important concepts for relating category theory to programming. In
this sense, polymorphism, algebraic data types, and the functor and
monad type classes, etc., are concepts which can be conceptualized or
are based on ideas from category theory. Even if its categorical
conceptualization is not necessary for its use, it's an ideal
complement for better understanding functional programming and its
theoretical foundations. (Haskell community)

Polymorphism refers to the fact that the type of a value may depend on
the context in which it is used. Algebraic data types have various
alternatives or constructors of values. Type classes allow to define
generic interfaces which exhibit characteristics common to a great
variety of types. Finally, a functor (in Haskell) is a class of types
which can be mapped and a monad (of Haskell) is a class of types which
introduces the concepts of context and the use of normal functions
which preserve the contexts of those contexts. (Real World Haskell).

The study of category theory will allow to understand and apply
effectively and efficiently the theoretical foundations of functional
programming. Category theory is a solid framework for a lot of
concepts of functional programming.

Even though the study of theoretical foundations of functional
programming is not strictly necessary for a programmer, it is an ideal
complement for his appropriate education and adequate understanding of
the theoretical and practical concepts of programming.

Even though the categorical formulation of some concepts may be
difficult to understand, category theory is a conceptual framework
which allows to deal with such concepts at a higher level of
abstraction.

``Some of the required functional constructions may be given natural
definitions within category theory'' \parencite[7]{pitt-1986}.






In summary, we study some concepts of functional programming through
category theory.






``Category-theoretic formulations of concepts can be more difficult to
grasp than their counterparts in other formalisms''
\parencite[xi]{pierce-1991}. ``One does not so much learn category
theory as absorb it over a period of time''
\parencite[25]{bird-demoor-1997}. ``From [116]: 'do not succumb to a
feeling that you must understand \emph{all} of category theory before
you put it to use'`` \parencite[xi]{pierce-1991}. ``Category theory
has been called 'abstract nonsense' by both its friends and its
detractors. Perhaps what this phrase suggests to both is that category
theory has relatively more form than content, compared to other areas
of mathematics'' \parencite[50]{goguen-1991}.

``Category theory can also be abused, and in several different styles.
One style of abuse is specious generality, in which some theory or
example is generalised in a way that does not actually include any new
examples of genuine interest. A related style of abuse is categorical
overkill, in which the language of category theory is used to describe
phenomena that do not actually require such an elaborate treatment or
terminology'' \parencite[50]{goguen-1991}.

``The trinity of concepts category, functor, and natural
transformation is what category theory is built on''
\parencite{nlab-category-theory}.

Category theory allows ``us to see the universal components of a
family of structures of a given kind, and how structures of different
kinds are interrelated'' \parencite[1]{marquis-2013}.

With category theory, ``concepts may be dealt with at a higher level''
\parencite[xi]{pierce-1991}.

``Category theory formalizes otherwise vague concepts''
\parencite[414]{poigne-1992}.

``Category theory provides a number of broadly useful, and yet
surprisingly specific, guidelines for organising, generalising, and
discovering analogies among and within various branches of mathematics
and its applications. I wish to suggest that the existence of such
guidelines can be seen to support an alternative, more pragmatic view:
Foundations should provide general concepts and tools that reveal the
structures and interrelations of various areas of mathematics and its
applications, and that help in doing and using mathematics''
\parencite[64]{goguen-1991}. ``In a field which is not yet very well
developed, such as computing science, where it often seems that
getting the definitions right is the hardest task, foundations in this
sense can be very useful, because they can suggest which research
directions may be fruitful, using relatively explicit measures of
elegance and coherence. The succesful use of category theory for such
purposes suggests that it provides at least the beginnings of such a
foundation'' \parencite[64]{goguen-1991}.

\section*{Summary of the project}
\label{sec:introduction-summary}

This is an undergraduate project submitted in partial fulfillment of
the requirements for the degree of Systems Engineering at EAFIT
University\footnote{\url{http://www.eafit.edu.co}}.


Having this into account (that it is possible to conceptualize many
concepts of functional programming via the study of category theory,
this project aims to develop a monographical study of category theory
which allows to describe and explain some of the applications to
functional programming. In particlar, ...

Our goal (objective) is to describe and explain some of the
applications of category theory to functional programming. More
specifically, to describe and explain the concepts of category theory
which allow us to conceptualize and better understand the following
concepts of functional programming: polymorphism, algebraic data
types, and the functor and monad type classes.

The product or result of this project is a monograph on category
theory and some of its applications to functional programming. This
monograph contains the results of the development of the project, that
is, the results of the writing stage.

\section*{Overview of the project}
\label{sec:introduction-overview}

This project is divided into six chapters organized like the tree
diagram in Figure \ref{fig:overview}:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:categories} (\nameref{chap:categories}), we
  define categories and commutative diagrams, and the categories which
  will allow us to relate category theory to functional programming in
  Haskell and Agda.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:constructions} (\nameref{chap:constructions}),
  we describe some basic constructions in categories (isomorphisms,
  initial and terminal objects, and products and coproducts), which we
  use for describing some concepts and examples in all subsequent
  chapters.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:functors} (\nameref{chap:functors}), we study
  functors and endofunctors in order to conceptualize and better
  understand functors in Haskell and Agda.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:naturals} (\nameref{chap:naturals}), we explore
  the connection between natural transformations and polymorphic
  functions in Haskell.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:monads} (\nameref{chap:monads}), we give a
  detailed account of monads and Kleisli triples, and their
  correspondence to monads in Haskell and Agda.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:algebras} (\nameref{chap:algebras}), we
  describe algebras and initial algebras over endofunctors, and their
  relation to algebraic data types in Haskell.

\item
  Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions} (\nameref{chap:conclusions})
  contains our conclusions and some ideas for future work.

\end{itemize}

Each chapter, except Chapter \ref{chap:constructions}, is further
subdivided into two or three sections concerning some concepts of
category theory, and their relation to functional programming in
Haskell and, in some cases, Agda. Additionally, each chapter ends with
a References section which collects the sources of information for all
definitions and examples.
