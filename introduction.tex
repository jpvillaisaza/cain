Category theory is a branch of mathematics developed in the 1940s
which has come to occupy a central position in computer science.
Broadly, it is a convenient and powerful conceptual framework or
language of structures and systems of structures
\parencites[vii]{maclane-1998}[1]{marquis-2013}[1154]{wolfram-2002}.

In computer science, category theory contributes to areas such as
automata theory, domain theory, functional programming, monads or
notions of computation, polymorphism, semantics, type theory, among
others
\parencites[23]{marquis-2013}{nlab-category-theory}[xi]{pierce-1991}[415]{poigne-1992}.

In computer science, category theory allows us to formulate
definitions and theories and to measure the elegance and coherence of
existing formulations, to carry out proofs, to discover and exploit
relations with other fields, to deal with abstraction and
representation independence, to formulate conjectures and research
directions, and to unify concepts \parencites[49--50]{goguen-1991}. In
addition, category theory is a foundational theory of functions which
provides a sound basis for functional programming
\parencite[414]{poigne-1992}.

``Category theory can be viewed as a formalization of operations on
abstract data types in computer languages''
\parencite[1154]{wolfram-2002}.






In functional programming,



``Most structures in mathematics are best understood from a category
theoretic viewpoint'' \parencite{nlab-category-theory}.



Seveveral concepts in Haskell are inspired or taken from category
theory. However, when these concepts are taken from category theory,
very little of the theory around them is brought along. This is why,
``despite claims to the contrary, one can be a perfectly competent
programmer without knowing anything at all about category theory. But,
if you are familiar with category theory, you can turn around and
apply it to Haskell.'' In a way, category theory provides tools for
analyzing and building such concepts \parencite[73]{elkins-2009}.

Some important concepts in functional programming languages such as
Haskell allow us to relate category theory and functional programming.
In this sense, polymorphism, algebraic data types, and the functor and
monad type classes, and the like, are concepts which can be
conceptualized or formalized, or are based on ideas from category
theory. Its categorical conceptualization is not necessary for its
use, but it is an ideal complement for better understanding functional
programming and its theoretical foundations.

Polymorphism refers to the fact that the type of a value may depend on
the context in which it is used. Algebraic data types have various
alternatives or constructors of values. Type classes allow to define
generic interfaces which exhibit characteristics common to a great
variety of types. Finally, a functor (in Haskell) is a class of types
which can be mapped and a monad (of Haskell) is a class of types which
introduces the concepts of context and the use of normal functions
which preserve the contexts of those contexts. (Real World Haskell).


Even though the study of theoretical foundations of functional
programming is not strictly necessary for a programmer


``Some of the required functional constructions may be given natural
definitions within category theory'' \parencite[7]{pitt-1986}.



In summary, we aim to study some concepts of functional programming
through category theory.





``Category-theoretic formulations of concepts can be more difficult to
grasp than their counterparts in other formalisms''
\parencite[xi]{pierce-1991}. ``One does not so much learn category
theory as absorb it over a period of time''
\parencite[25]{bird-demoor-1997}. ``From [116]: 'do not succumb to a
feeling that you must understand \emph{all} of category theory before
you put it to use'`` \parencite[xi]{pierce-1991}. ``Category theory
has been called 'abstract nonsense' by both its friends and its
detractors. Perhaps what this phrase suggests to both is that category
theory has relatively more form than content, compared to other areas
of mathematics'' \parencite[50]{goguen-1991}. Even though the
categorical formulation of some concepts may be difficult to
understand, category theory is a conceptual framework which allows to
deal with such concepts at a higher level of abstraction.


``The trinity of concepts category, functor, and natural
transformation is what category theory is built on''
\parencite{nlab-category-theory}.

With category theory, ``concepts may be dealt with at a higher level''
\parencite[xi]{pierce-1991}. ``Category theory formalizes otherwise
vague concepts'' \parencite[414]{poigne-1992}.

\section*{Summary of the project}
\label{sec:introduction-summary}

This is an undergraduate project submitted in partial fulfillment of
the requirements for the degree of Systems Engineering at EAFIT
University\footnote{\url{http://www.eafit.edu.co}}.

As a summary of the project proposal,
our goal or objective is to describe and explain some of the
applications of category theory to functional programming. More
specifically, we aim to describe and explain the concepts of category
theory which allow us to concetualize or formalize and better
understand algebraic data types, functors, monads, polymorphism. We
use Haskell for every concept, Agda for functors and monads.

\section*{Audience and prerequisites}
\label{sec:introduction-prerequisites}

The reader of this project is a mathematically inclined functional
programmer with some mathematical background. In other words, we
assume some mathematical background and a working knowledge of
functional programming in Haskell and Agda. If any further background
material is needed, it can be found in the references on page
\pageref{sec:introduction-references} or in the bibliographical
remarks at the end of each chapter, which describe where appropriate
background material can be found.

\section*{Overview of the project}
\label{sec:introduction-overview}

This project is divided into six chapters organized like the tree
diagram in Figure \ref{fig:overview}:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:categories} (\nameref{chap:categories}), we
  define categories and commutative diagrams, and the categories which
  will allow us to relate category theory to functional programming in
  Haskell and Agda.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:constructions} (\nameref{chap:constructions}),
  we describe some basic constructions in categories (isomorphisms,
  initial and terminal objects, and products and coproducts), which we
  use for describing some concepts and examples in all subsequent
  chapters.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:functors} (\nameref{chap:functors}), we study
  functors and endofunctors in order to conceptualize and better
  understand functors in Haskell and Agda.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:naturals} (\nameref{chap:naturals}), we explore
  the connection between natural transformations and polymorphic
  functions in Haskell.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:monads} (\nameref{chap:monads}), we give a
  detailed account of monads and Kleisli triples, and their
  correspondence to monads in Haskell and Agda.

\item
  In Chapter \ref{chap:algebras} (\nameref{chap:algebras}), we
  describe algebras and initial algebras over endofunctors, and their
  relation to algebraic data types in Haskell.

\item
  Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions} (\nameref{chap:conclusions})
  contains our conclusions and some ideas for future work.

\end{itemize}

Each chapter, except Chapter \ref{chap:constructions}, is further
subdivided into two or three sections concerning some concepts of
category theory, and their relation to functional programming in
Haskell and, in some cases, Agda. Additionally, each chapter ends with
a References section which collects the sources of information for all
definitions and examples.
